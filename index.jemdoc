== Research Interests
I am an experimentalist and computational scientist bringing in tools from machine-learning and computer vision to neuroscience.\n 
I am particularly interested in how stimulus and behavior is encoded in /C. elegans/ brain, and how global brain activity evolves over long timescales.\n 
\n
My current PhD work areas include:
- Automated cell identification in /C. elegans/ whole-brain images
- Hybrid probabilistic graphical models for accurate tracking of neurons in whole-brain videos
- Deep learning based whole-brain 3D cell segmentation
- Microfluidic paradigms for naturalistic chemical-mechanical stimulation and simultaneous whole-brain imaging
\n
\n
I easily get interested in broad scientific areas. Thus I am also interested in *Computational Microscopy*, *Optimization Methods*, *Optimal Transport*, *Deep Learning for Combinatorial Optimization* etc.

== Bio
I was trained as a Chemical Engineer at IIT Kanpur where I finished BS-MS dual degree in 2013. There I worked with [https://www.iitk.ac.in/che/faculty/bhattacharya_pk/people.htm Prof. P. K. Bhattacharya] on computational modelling of water management in PEM fuel cells and effects of Schroeder's Paradox. After graduating, I worked with a Management Consulting firm developing data-driven solutions for international firms like Wolters Kluwers, Assurant, T-Mobile. Since 2016 I am a PhD Candidate at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Hang Lu, where I work on developing tools for fast and easy processing of whole-brain functional imaging data.
